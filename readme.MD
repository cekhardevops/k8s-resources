***when we deploy multi containers on the same pod, both containers share same network namespace and storage which means they can communicate with each with localhost***

**when user sends to request to either of the continers running on the same pod, nginx serves the request Here’s why and how this happens:**

Shared Network: Containers in the same Pod share the same IP address and localhost network interface. When you run curl localhost from the container otherthan nginx running container, it is effectively sending the request to the localhost of the Pod, which is also shared by the Nginx container.

Nginx Running on Port 80: Nginx is typically configured to listen on port 80 by default. Since the two containers are in the same network space, your curl localhost request is hitting Nginx on port 80, and that’s why you see the Nginx page.

Multiple containers can run on same pod when they need to work together and share the certain resources.

ex: as shown in the daigram, one pod works as proxy and handles the request and other collects the logs generated by nginx server and pushes to elastic search. so, nginx have less burgen and only handles incoming request.
